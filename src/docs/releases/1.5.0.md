# Orchard Core 1.5.0

## Breaking Changes

* The `OrchardCore_Media_AmazonS3` config section was changed: `RegionEndpoint` was renamed to `Region` and extracted from `Credentials` section to the root section of `OrchardCore_Media_AmazonS3`, `AccessKeyId` was renamed to `AccessKey`, `ProfileName` was renamed to `Profile`. See [this pull request](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/11871) for details.
